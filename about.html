        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a critical thinker and curiosity-driven person who feels at home in multicultural environments.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My passion for sustainability and the energy transition led me to study Chemical and Energy Engineering, and later to land my current job as an Innovation project manager in an energy utility company.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In parallel to my “scientific side”, I also have an artistic one which I’ve nurtured via hobbies and volunteer work. I’ve learned about graphic and UX Design, and full stack development seemed like an opportunity to combine these two parts of me into one. After doing a web development bootcamp, I’ve joined a coding school to dig further into how some of the tools I had learnt to use actually work, and to explore other areas of programming. More recently I took a part-time introductory course to data science, to gather more tools I could apply at my current job.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a conclusion, I keep a foot in the energy field and another in the tech world. What matters most is to be in an environment where my work has a meaning and learning is a constant.</p>
