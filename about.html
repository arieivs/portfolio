        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm passionate about Sustainability, Renewable Energy and working in multicultural environments. Just graduated from a Full Stack development bootcamp, currently looking for the next opportunity to gain experience as a junior developer!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During my studies in Chemical and Energy Engineering I’ve focused mostly in the intersection between the two, which translates into things like bioplastics, biodiesel and waste to energy. I wanted to dive deeper into the programming world, so I’ve recently completed an intensive web development bootcamp, and now I wish to combine my interests in renewable energy and sustainability with my recently acquired coding skills. In parallel to my “scientific side”, I also have an artistic one which I’ve nurtured via hobbies and volunteer work. I’ve learned about graphic and UX Design due to my work for the <a href="https://issuu.com/communitybyinnoenergy/docs/3rd_mag_online" target="_blank" class="text-link">CommUnity Post</a> and full stack development seemed like an opportunity to finally combine these two parts of me into one.</p>
